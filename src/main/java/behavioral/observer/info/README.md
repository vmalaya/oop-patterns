# Observer

### IMPL

### Info

- Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one 
  object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated 
  automatically.
- Java provides inbuilt platform for implementing Observer pattern through java.util.Observable
  class and java.util.Observer interface.

### Example usage

- Java Message Service (JMS) (allows applications to subscribe and publish data to other applications)
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) (process of registering to get notified of any change to the model)
